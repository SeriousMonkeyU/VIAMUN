The purpose of this project is to support the already existing simulation of Model
United Nations – Crisis Committee, by reducing reaction times needed to respond to
problems, as well as eliminating unnecessary misunderstandings which are coming
from different handwritings, or incoherent speeches between active participants in the
stated system.
This project work is based on Scrum and Unified Process methodologies, which
helped the team to structure their work throughout the project. In the analysis part
multiple diagrams are presented to better view previously mentioned structure. The
Design part mostly displays the composition of class diagrams, ER and EER diagrams
of the database as well as one of the main focuses of this project – User Interface.
Implementation and Tests are commenting on the specific code parts as well as tests
for them.
The development of the project was based on the Java programming language,
using support programs, such as: Astah, DataGrip, Intellij IDEA.
The result of the project is a completely functioning system, featuring multi
window view, between sixteen different users, connected by server-client relation, with
simplistic user interface.
